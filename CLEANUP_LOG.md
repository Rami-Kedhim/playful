## Type Definitions and Error Fixes

Fixed various TypeScript errors by:

2. Aligning boost-related types in src/hooks/boost/types.ts and src/types/pulse-boost.d.ts
3. Updating core system interfaces in src/types/core-systems.ts
4. Implementing missing methods in core system classes

## Security Enhancements

1. Implemented Orus security validation in route wrappers
2. Added SecureRouteWrapper component for standardized security protocols
3. Established consistent security indicators on all pages

## Unified Layout and Navigation

1. Standardized all pages to use the unified Layout component
2. Implemented consistent security indicators and breadcrumbs
3. Unified navigation patterns across all pages

## Final Verification

All required modules are now properly structured and aligned with the UberEscorts ecosystem standards. The project is ready for deployment and further module development.
